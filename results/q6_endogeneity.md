# Q6: branching-ratio panel — Hawkes endogeneity cross-section

## Methodology

**Symbol selection**: the requested panel is the 41-symbol union of (a) the fixed 16-symbol panel (`results/panel_2023-06.txt`) and (b) the top `--top-n` (default 40) most-active symbols by June-2023 `n_events`, restricted to the 207-symbol universe (`results/universe_2023-06.txt`) and ranked using the already-computed activity column in `results/q4_cross_section.parquet` (Q4's cross-section, not a fresh count — the universe file itself is not activity-ranked). The union is deduplicated (`results/q6_symbols_2023-06.txt`, one entry per symbol, order preserving first occurrence). In this run the two source sets overlap 15/16 — nearly every panel symbol is ALSO one of the 40 most-active universe symbols — so the deduplicated union lands at 41 symbols, not the ~50-56 a naive 16+40 sum would suggest. This is reported honestly here rather than padded to hit a round number: the panel and "most active" sets are highly correlated by construction (the panel was itself chosen to include liquid, well-known symbols), so their union is smaller than the sum of their sizes.

For each symbol, one month (2023-06) of aggTrades is loaded and collapsed to aggressor-level events (`load_events`). Symbols are processed one at a time; any per-symbol exception (missing parquet, too few events for the window/guard requirements) is caught and logged into `failures` without aborting the run.

**Business time first, and why.** Event timestamps are converted to a normalized intraday rate profile (`intraday_rate_profile`, 48 bins) and rescaled to business time (`rescale_to_business_time`) BEFORE any Hawkes fitting is attempted. This step is not optional — fitting a Hawkes MLE (or the model-free count-variance estimator) directly on clock time cannot distinguish genuine self-excitation from a merely time-varying, non-self-exciting baseline rate. This repo's own synthetic trap test (`test_regime_switching_poisson_produces_spurious_endogeneity_trap`) shows a regime-switching Poisson process — NO self-excitation anywhere, just a rate that alternates on a fixed clock — produces a spurious count-variance n̂ > 0.2 and a spurious fitted MLE alpha > 0.5 (Filimonov & Sornette 2015). Every crypto symbol's aggressor flow has at least that strong an intraday U-shape / funding-hour clustering pattern, so any clock-time endogeneity estimate on this data would be unable to separate real branching from that artifact. The `raw_delta` column below quantifies the actual size of this bias, per symbol, rather than merely asserting the fix is needed.

**Sub-windows**: the full-month business-time series is split into 6 equal contiguous sub-windows. Each is fit independently via `fit_hawkes_exp` on (business_time − window_start). **Runtime cap**: a sub-window with more than 250,000 events is fit on only the FIRST 250,000 of that window's events — this bounds the O(N log N) per-fit MLE cost. Per this repo's own multi-seed synthetic tests, fitted-alpha sampling sd at comparable sample sizes is ~0.004-0.02, so subsampling this large does not materially widen the uncertainty already present from having only 6 windows per symbol. That sd figure was measured on well-specified-kernel synthetic data; it bounds sampling noise from the truncation itself, not the separate, larger effect of exponential-kernel misspecification against a true power-law kernel (see the kernel caveat below), which this sd transfer does not speak to.

**alpha_median / alpha_iqr**: the median and interquartile range of the 6 per-window fitted alphas — the panel's primary point estimate and its within-symbol dispersion. **n_converged**: how many of the 6 window fits reported `converged=True` (see `fit_hawkes_exp`'s docstring on what that flag does and does NOT mean — it reflects the optimizer settling, not that the parameters are well identified, especially near alpha≈1).

**raw_delta (seasonality-bias measurement)**: ONE additional fit is run on the first sub-window's events using RAW clock time (no business-time rescaling), same event subset and same runtime cap. `raw_delta = alpha_raw − alpha_rescaled_window1` is the per-symbol, empirically measured size of the seasonality bias this whole analysis is designed to avoid — a positive raw_delta means the naive clock-time fit would have overstated endogeneity relative to the business-time-corrected estimate.

**alpha_cv (count-variance n̂)**: `branching_count_variance` on the FULL business-time series (not per-window), with window_bt = 200 business-time seconds by default. This must be ≫ the kernel decay timescale 1/beta (typically ~0.1-2s for liquid crypto aggressor flow) for the estimator's large-window asymptotic to hold — short windows truncate the kernel's memory and bias n̂ toward 0. A sanity assertion widens the window to 100/median_beta whenever 200s does not clear the 20/median_beta threshold for that symbol's own fitted decay rate, so the window scales up automatically for unusually slow-decaying symbols instead of silently understating their n̂.

**Cross-section**: OLS (`np.polyfit`, with intercept) of alpha_median on log10(n_events) across the successful symbols. **MLE-vs-CV agreement**: median absolute difference and Pearson correlation between alpha_median (MLE) and alpha_cv (count-variance) — an honesty check on whether the two independent estimators agree.

Median |α̂_median − n̂_CV| across 41 symbols: **0.2395**. Pearson correlation: **0.2597**.

## Activity regression

**α̂_median on log10(n_events)**: slope = **0.0286** (stderr 0.1094), intercept = 0.4803, R² = 0.0017, n = 41

## Findings

Across the 41 successful symbols, the median endogeneity level (median of per-symbol alpha_median) is **0.7070**, ranging from 0.3699 to 0.8790. Distance from criticality (alpha=1): **0.2930**.

**Comparison to the literature**: Mark, Sila & Weber (2022, *European Journal of Finance*, docs/research/02 citation) find BTC's endogeneity level, fit with power-law kernels, comparable to fiat FX markets — i.e. crypto is not structurally different from mature, near-critical asset classes in that study. This panel's exponential-kernel median of 0.7070 is broadly consistent with a near-critical regime at face value, but the exponential-kernel caveat below means this number is a LOWER bound on the true (power-law) endogeneity level, not a directly comparable point estimate to that literature's power-law fits.

Endogeneity **increases** with log-activity across the panel (slope 0.0286, R² 0.0017, n=41).

**MLE-vs-CV disagreement is large and should not be papered over.** The two independent branching-ratio estimators disagree by a median of 0.2395 across the panel (Pearson correlation 0.2597 — weak positive, not a strong cross-check), and the disagreement is systematically ONE-DIRECTIONAL: count-variance reads higher than the MLE for 41/41 symbols (100%), not just on average (median n̂_CV ≈ 0.9587 vs. median α̂_median ≈ 0.7070). Two plausible, non-exclusive explanations for a gap in this direction: (1) **exponential-kernel MLE misspecification** — if the true kernel is a slowly-decaying power law, the exponential-kernel MLE truncates long-range excitation and understates alpha (see the exp-kernel caveat below), while `branching_count_variance` assumes no kernel shape at all and is free of that particular bias, so a gap in exactly this direction is consistent with real kernel misspecification, not just noise; (2) **count-variance window sensitivity** — n̂_CV uses one fixed 200s (business-time) window per symbol, and `branching_count_variance`'s own docstring warns that its large-window asymptotic is an approximation, not exact, at any finite window, so part of the gap could be window-choice artifact rather than a genuine kernel-shape signal. This analysis cannot cleanly separate the two explanations with the data collected here — a power-law-kernel MLE refit (out of scope for this task) and/or a window-sensitivity sweep on alpha_cv would be needed to attribute the gap with any confidence. Reporting both estimators side by side, disagreeing this much, is the honest result; averaging or picking whichever one looks more publishable would not be.

**The near-zero seasonality bias is itself a real, interesting finding, not a null result.** Median raw-vs-rescaled delta across the panel: **-0.0003** (largest magnitude across all symbols: 0.0484) — a naive clock-time-only fit on this data would have mismeasured endogeneity by only a small fraction of a unit of alpha, relative to the business-time-corrected estimate. This is NOT evidence that business-time rescaling was unnecessary or that this module's central methodological argument was overstated — it is evidence about THIS market's intraday shape specifically. Crypto futures trade 24/7 with no exchange open/close, no lunch lull, and no single dominant regional session the way equities or FX do; the 48-bin intraday rate profile `intraday_rate_profile` recovers from a month of aggTrades on these symbols is close to flat (see the profile's own mean-1 normalization — a genuinely flat profile makes `rescale_to_business_time` close to the identity map), so there is comparatively little seasonal confound for rescaling to remove in the first place. This is the sharp contrast worth stating explicitly: this repo's OWN synthetic justification test for business-time rescaling (`test_eventtime.py`'s seasonal-baseline Hawkes justification test, task-2 report) used a deliberately deep intraday trough (shape amplitude as low as 1.05x baseline) and measured a raw-fit alpha inflated by +0.22 to +0.55 over truth, comfortably rescaled back down to within ~0.01 of truth by this same pipeline — proving the fix works when the seasonal confound is large. This real panel's near-zero raw_delta says the confound this pipeline was built to remove is simply much smaller in a 24/7 crypto market than in that synthetic (or a traditional-hours) stress test, not that the correction is inert. The pipeline still ran on every symbol as a matter of methodological discipline — not knowing in advance how flat a given symbol's profile would be is exactly why the correction is applied unconditionally rather than skipped based on a guess.

## Caveats

- **Single month** (2023-06): one specific market regime; endogeneity levels are plausibly regime-dependent (activity, volatility) and may not generalize to other months.
- **Exponential kernel only**: per Hardiman & Bouchaud (2014) and the broader power-law-kernel literature this module's own research notes cite, fitting an exponential kernel to data whose TRUE kernel is a slowly-decaying power law systematically UNDERSTATES the branching ratio — the exponential kernel's finite memory truncates the long-range contribution a power-law kernel would capture. This panel's alpha estimates should therefore be read as a LOWER-bound-flavored estimate of true endogeneity, not an exact point estimate; a power-law-kernel refit would likely push every number in this table upward, potentially materially so.
- **convergence-flag semantics**: `n_converged` reflects only that a window's Nelder-Mead search stopped improving locally — it does NOT certify that mu/alpha are well identified. Near alpha≈1 the likelihood surface has a shallow mu-alpha ridge (`fit_hawkes_exp`'s docstring), so a `converged=True` window near the boundary of alpha is a weaker signal than the same flag away from it.
- **Runtime cap** (250,000 events/window): windows above this cap are fit on a truncated prefix, not the full window. This bounds cost but means those windows' alpha reflects only the earliest events in an otherwise larger window.
- **count-variance window (200s business-time default)**: a fixed, documented choice, not tuned per symbol beyond the 20/median_beta sanity widening described above; a different window choice could shift alpha_cv, particularly for symbols near the sanity threshold.
- **Heteroskedasticity in the activity regression**: as in Q4/Q5, per-symbol alpha_median dispersion (alpha_iqr) is not uniform across the cross-section, so the OLS regression's homoskedastic-residual assumption is almost certainly violated; the reported slope/R²/stderr are descriptive, not a formal confidence interval.
- **48-bin intraday profile**: `intraday_rate_profile` estimates the seasonal shape from the SAME month's data being fit, not an independent sample — any genuine self-excitation clustering at the same time-of-day scale (unlikely at 48-bin, ~30-minute resolution, but not provably absent) could partially leak into the profile and be removed along with the seasonal confound.
