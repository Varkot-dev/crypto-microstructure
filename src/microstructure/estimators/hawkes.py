"""Univariate exponential-kernel Hawkes process: simulator, MLE, count-variance.

Parameterization: intensity λ(t) = mu + Σ_{t_i < t} alpha*beta*exp(-beta*(t-t_i)).
The kernel is φ(t) = alpha*beta*exp(-beta*t); its integral over [0, ∞) is
    ∫ alpha*beta*exp(-beta*t) dt = alpha*beta * (1/beta) = alpha,
so **alpha IS the branching ratio n** (Hawkes & Oakes 1974 branching
interpretation: docs/research/02-hawkes-processes.md §1 "Branching interpretation
and criticality"). alpha in [0, 1) for a stationary process; alpha -> 1 is
criticality; alpha >= 1 is explosive/non-stationary.

Three independent estimators are provided so they can cross-check each
other, as the literature insists on (docs/research/02 §4 "Non-negotiables:
... report n̂ sensitivity to window and kernel family"):
  - simulate_hawkes_exp: ground truth via Ogata (1978) thinning.
  - fit_hawkes_exp: parametric MLE using the O(N) exponential-kernel
    recursion, optimized with a hand-rolled multi-start Nelder-Mead
    (numpy only, no scipy).
  - branching_count_variance: Hardiman & Bouchaud (2014) model-free
    estimator from count mean/variance alone — no kernel shape assumed.

The Poisson-refutation / regime-switching trap tests in
tests/estimators/test_hawkes.py document a critical failure mode: on a
non-stationary-rate (but NOT self-exciting) process, both a Hawkes MLE and
the count-variance estimator report spurious positive endogeneity
(Filimonov & Sornette 2015, docs/research/02 §"The calibration counterattack").
This motivates deseasonalizing mu(t) before ever trusting an n̂ on real
data.

    λ(t) = mu_bar*shape(tod(t)) + Σ_{t_i < t} alpha*beta*exp(-beta*(t - t_i))

    where `shape` is an `n_bins`-length array (mean 1 by construction, as
    returned by `microstructure.signals.eventtime.intraday_rate_profile`)
    giving the baseline-rate multiplier for each equal-width time-of-day bin
    over a 24h period (period = 86400 SECONDS here, since this module works
    in float seconds, not the eventtime module's epoch-ms; the caller is
    responsible for keeping units consistent, e.g. by choosing `shape` to
    represent one bin per 86400/n_bins seconds and treating `t=0` as the
    start of a day). `tod(t)` is `t mod 86400`.

    This is the honest generative model this module was missing: unlike
    thinning an already-simulated homogeneous-mu Hawkes process by a
    time-of-day mask (an approximation used in
    tests/signals/test_eventtime.py's `_thin_by_daily_profile` secondary
    control test — see that test's docstring), this simulator makes the
    baseline rate itself seasonal from the start, so it does not also
    discard already-realized self-excited "child" events the way
    post-hoc thinning does. It is the correct tool for testing that
    business-time rescaling recovers the true branching ratio from a
    seasonality-confounded Hawkes fit.

    Algorithm: same Ogata (1978) thinning / exponential-kernel excitation
    tracking as `simulate_hawkes_exp`, except the constant `mu` is replaced
    by `mu_bar*shape[bin_idx(t)]` and the thinning upper bound
    `lambda_bar = mu_bar*max(shape) + excitation + alpha*beta` uses the
    seasonal peak (`max(shape)`) instead of a constant baseline, since the
    baseline term is no longer constant between accepted events (only the
    excitation term's monotonic decay is exploited for the bound, same as
    the unseasonal simulator; the baseline swap point (bin boundary) is a
    negligible/zero-measure event under continuous-time thinning so no
    special-casing across bin boundaries is required for correctness).

    Sanity property: with `shape` identically 1 everywhere, this reduces
    statistically to `simulate_hawkes_exp(mu_bar, alpha, beta, t_end, seed)`
    (same distribution, not necessarily the same realized event times,
    since the acceptance draws differ once `lambda_bar` differs — verified
    in tests/estimators/test_hawkes.py via matched event-count and fitted-
    parameter statistics, not exact event-time equality).

    shallow ridge along which mu and alpha trade off (a small-mu/high-n

    pitfall 5), so a fit can report `converged=True` while sitting

    less trustworthy than `converged=True` alone would suggest. Multi-

    Optimizes over 1+2K unconstrained parameters (log mu, K alpha-logits
    mapped through `_alphas_from_logits` so Σalpha_k < 1 always holds, K
    log-betas) using the same hand-rolled Nelder-Mead as `fit_hawkes_exp`,
    multi-started from `betas_init` (default: log-spaced across decades —
    0.1, 1, 10, ... per unit time, extended/truncated to K values — so the
    mixture is initialized to actually span timescales rather than
    collapsing to K copies of the same decay rate) combined with a few
    perturbed alpha/mu starting points.

    For K=1 this must (and, per `test_multiexp_k1_matches_fit_hawkes_exp`,
    does) reproduce `fit_hawkes_exp` on the same data: with one component the
    alpha-logit softmax-with-slack-slot reduces exactly to a logistic map
    into (0,1), i.e. the same reparameterization `fit_hawkes_exp` uses, and
    the log-likelihoods (`hawkes_multiexp_loglik` vs `hawkes_loglik`) are the
    same expression with one term, so both optimizers search the identical
    surface. In practice two independent Nelder-Mead runs (different simplex
    paths, including different multi-start beta seeds) land within ~1e-7 of
    each other in log-likelihood and mu/alpha, and ~1e-5 in beta (the
    flattest direction near the optimum) — see
    `test_multiexp_k1_matches_fit_hawkes_exp`'s measured diffs and asserted
    tolerances (loglik/mu/alpha at 1e-5, beta at 1e-4). This is the floor
    set by each optimizer's own tol=1e-6 f-spread stopping criterion, not a
    discrepancy between the two code paths.

    THE POINT OF THIS FUNCTION (docs/research/02-hawkes-processes.md §4
    pitfall 3): a single exponential is too short-memoried to represent a
    long-memory/power-law-like true kernel, so a K=1 fit systematically
    underestimates n = Σalpha_k. Increasing K lets the mixture spread mass
    across widely-separated timescales and recover more of the long-lag
    kernel weight, pulling n̂ up toward the true value. Re-fitting the same
    data at K=1,2,3 and reporting how n̂ MOVES across K (see
    `branching_ratio_sensitivity`) is therefore the intended diagnostic on
    real data, not a nuisance to average away.

    KNOWN IDENTIFIABILITY WEAKNESS AT LARGE K: once K exceeds the number of
    timescales actually resolvable from the data's sample size and window,
    components become interchangeable/degenerate (two components can trade
    off alpha and beta against each other while barely changing the
    likelihood, similar in spirit to the near-critical mu/alpha ridge
    documented on `fit_hawkes_exp`). Individual `alphas`/`betas` at K=3 and
    above should be treated as much less identified than their sum n; this
    is why `branching_ratio_sensitivity`'s docs recommend reporting n̂(K),
    not the per-component parameters, as the headline diagnostic.

    `converged` HAS THE SAME CAVEAT AS `fit_hawkes_exp`'s: it reflects ONLY
    that the winning start's Nelder-Mead simplex stopped spreading out in
    log-likelihood (the tol=1e-6 f-spread criterion), NOT that the
    parameters are well identified. This is *more* likely to bite at K>=2
    than in the single-exponential case: a K=3 fit can report
    `converged=True` while sitting on a degenerate ridge where two
    components have nearly duplicate betas and one carries almost all the
    weight -- e.g. `test_multiexp_k3_on_two_exp_data_does_not_blow_up`'s own
    planted-data K=3 fit converges to alphas=(0.348, 0.007, 0.245) with
    betas=(0.194, 4.890, 4.890), a duplicate-beta pair splitting what a
    correctly-specified K=2 fit represents as one component. The SUM n is
    still trustworthy there (it matches K=2 to three decimal places); the
    individual per-component (alpha, beta) values are not, regardless of
    what `converged` says.

    CONFOUND WARNING — BASELINE NON-STATIONARITY CAN MIMIC LONG MEMORY: a
    K=1 -> K=2 rise in n̂ together with a slow (small beta) second
    component is the SAME numerical signature produced by two completely
    different underlying causes, and n̂(K) alone cannot distinguish them:
      1. Genuine long-memory kernel (the motivating case above): the extra
         slow component recovers real, slowly-decaying self-excitation mass
         a K=1 fit truncated.
      2. Residual baseline non-stationarity (Filimonov & Sornette 2015,
         also documented on `simulate_seasonal_hawkes_exp` /
         `branching_count_variance`): if mu(t) is not actually constant
         (imperfect deseasonalization, a regime change, a slow intraday
         drift) but the model assumes constant mu, the misspecified
         exponential-kernel MLE can "explain" the baseline's slow swings by
         inventing a spurious slow self-exciting component instead -- the
         mixture fits the drift, not real branching. This is the exact same
         family of failure as the regime-switching trap already documented
         on `branching_count_variance` and exercised in
         `test_regime_switching_produces_spurious_endogeneity`, now shown to
         also fool the MULTI-exponential MLE, not just the single-exponential
         one or the count-variance estimator.
         `test_seasonal_baseline_confound_mimics_long_memory` demonstrates
         this concretely: a TRUE single-exponential Hawkes process (n=0.4,
         beta=2.0, no long memory at all) with a piecewise-constant ±30%
         baseline wobble produces n̂1=0.46 -> n̂2=0.83 with a spurious
         beta≈0.02 "slow" component, the same qualitative signature as the
         genuine-long-memory headline test.

    PER-SYMBOL OBSERVABLE TO REPORT (so this can be diagnosed on real data,
    not just guessed at): for any slow component that appears when K
    increases, report its timescale 1/beta_slow next to (a) the
    deseasonalization bin width used to build mu(t) and (b) the fit-window
    length. If 1/beta_slow is comparable to or larger than the
    deseasonalization bin width, or is a large fraction of the fit-window
    length, the "slow component" is a prime suspect for absorbed baseline
    drift rather than real long-memory self-excitation -- a genuine
    long-memory timescale should be well inside the fit window and
    unrelated to the deseasonalization binning choice.

    THE CONTROL: re-fit K=1 with a block-wise PIECEWISE-CONSTANT mu(t)
    (one free mu per block, e.g. matching the deseasonalization bins or the
    non-stationarity block length under suspicion) instead of a single
    constant mu, then re-run the K=1 vs K=2 comparison. If the spurious slow
    component VANISHES once the baseline is allowed to vary block-wise, the
    original K=1->K=2 jump was baseline drift, not kernel misspecification.
    If it persists even with a flexible block-wise baseline soaking up the
    non-stationarity, that is evidence for genuine long memory. This module
    does not yet implement a block-wise-mu variant of `fit_hawkes_multiexp`
    (see `simulate_seasonal_hawkes_exp` for the seasonal SIMULATOR
    counterpart) -- running this control is a prerequisite for trusting any
    single-symbol K=1->K=2 jump as evidence of long memory, not an optional
    nicety.

    likelihood-ratio standards, yet the generative process has no second
    timescale at all. The "slow" component is not a local-optimum fluke in
    general (a wider `betas_init` search can still land on it); it is the
    K=2 model's extra flexibility fitting sampling noise in a finite sample.
    This means `n_hat_2` carries an intrinsic upward finite-sample bias
    relative to `n_hat_1` even when K=1 is exactly correct, and Delta21 must
    be judged against the SIZE of that bias at the relevant sample size, not
    against a fixed tolerance chosen without reference to it.

    This function simulates `n_sims` independent single-exponential Hawkes
    processes with the given (mu, alpha, beta), each sized (via `t_end`) to
    land close to `n_events_per_window` events, fits both K=1 and K=2 via
    `fit_hawkes_multiexp` on each, and returns the array of per-simulation
    Delta21 = n_hat_2 - n_hat_1. This is the null distribution a real
    symbol's observed Delta21 should be compared against: a real Delta21
    that does not exceed (e.g.) this null's 90th percentile is "within
    finite-sample null" -- i.e. no more than what a well-specified K=1
    process of the same sample size would produce anyway -- rather than
    evidence of genuine long-memory kernel structure.

    THE BIAS SHRINKS WITH SAMPLE SIZE, AND MUST BE CALIBRATED AT THE PANEL'S
    ACTUAL PER-WINDOW EVENT COUNT: more events per window pin down the K=1
    fit's residual gaps more tightly, leaving less unexplained noise for a
    second component to absorb, so the median null Delta21 falls as
    `n_events_per_window` grows (measured: median null Delta21 ~0.003-0.02 at
    ~10k events per window vs. a few times smaller at ~40k, over independent
    seeds -- exact values are noisy with only a handful of simulations, which
    is why `n_sims` should be large enough for a stable percentile in
    production use). Since Q6b caps any single window's fit at
    `MAX_FIT_EVENTS=250_000` events, the null must be simulated at the
    PANEL's actual median per-window event count (post-cap), not at an
    arbitrary or worst-case size -- calibrating at a smaller size than the
    real windows overstates the null (too permissive would be the opposite
    error: calibrating at a larger size understates it and makes genuine
    long-memory harder to detect).

    `t_end` per simulation is derived from `n_events_per_window` via the
    exponential-kernel process's theoretical mean rate
    `mu / (1 - alpha)` events per unit time (exact for a stationary Hawkes
    process: each immigrant plus its full branching-process descendant tree
    contributes `1/(1-alpha)` events in expectation), so the realized event
    count lands close to (not exactly at, since simulation is stochastic)
    the requested size.

        n_hat = 1 - sqrt(mean(N_W) / var(N_W)).

    This requires windows W much larger than the kernel timescale
    (1/beta for the exponential kernel) — the large-window asymptotic is
    what makes the estimator "see" the amplification from clustering
    rather than just Poisson counting noise; too-small windows bias
    n_hat toward 0 (docs/research/02 §4: "short windows truncate long-memory
    kernels and bias n̂ down"). No kernel shape is assumed, which is the
    estimator's advantage (and, per the regime-switching trap test in
    tests/estimators/test_hawkes.py, also its weakness: it cannot
    distinguish real self-excitation from non-stationary baseline rate).

    number of bins (>10^9 — see max_windows derivation below), or if the
