"""Univariate exponential-kernel Hawkes process: simulator, MLE, count-variance.

Parameterization: intensity λ(t) = mu + Σ_{t_i < t} alpha*beta*exp(-beta*(t-t_i)).
The kernel is φ(t) = alpha*beta*exp(-beta*t); its integral over [0, ∞) is
    ∫ alpha*beta*exp(-beta*t) dt = alpha*beta * (1/beta) = alpha,
so **alpha IS the branching ratio n** (Hawkes & Oakes 1974 branching
interpretation: docs/research/02-hawkes-processes.md §1 "Branching interpretation
and criticality"). alpha in [0, 1) for a stationary process; alpha -> 1 is
criticality; alpha >= 1 is explosive/non-stationary.

Three independent estimators are provided so they can cross-check each
other, as the literature insists on (docs/research/02 §4 "Non-negotiables:
... report n̂ sensitivity to window and kernel family"):
  - simulate_hawkes_exp: ground truth via Ogata (1978) thinning.
  - fit_hawkes_exp: parametric MLE using the O(N) exponential-kernel
    recursion, optimized with a hand-rolled multi-start Nelder-Mead
    (numpy only, no scipy).
  - branching_count_variance: Hardiman & Bouchaud (2014) model-free
    estimator from count mean/variance alone — no kernel shape assumed.

The Poisson-refutation / regime-switching trap tests in
tests/estimators/test_hawkes.py document a critical failure mode: on a
non-stationary-rate (but NOT self-exciting) process, both a Hawkes MLE and
the count-variance estimator report spurious positive endogeneity
(Filimonov & Sornette 2015, docs/research/02 §"The calibration counterattack").
This motivates deseasonalizing mu(t) before ever trusting an n̂ on real
data.

    """Simulate a Hawkes process with a periodic (24h), piecewise-constant baseline.

    λ(t) = mu_bar*shape(tod(t)) + Σ_{t_i < t} alpha*beta*exp(-beta*(t - t_i))

    where `shape` is an `n_bins`-length array (mean 1 by construction, as
    returned by `microstructure.signals.eventtime.intraday_rate_profile`)
    giving the baseline-rate multiplier for each equal-width time-of-day bin
    over a 24h period (period = 86400 SECONDS here, since this module works
    in float seconds, not the eventtime module's epoch-ms; the caller is
    responsible for keeping units consistent, e.g. by choosing `shape` to
    represent one bin per 86400/n_bins seconds and treating `t=0` as the
    start of a day). `tod(t)` is `t mod 86400`.

    This is the honest generative model this module was missing: unlike
    thinning an already-simulated homogeneous-mu Hawkes process by a
    time-of-day mask (an approximation used in
    tests/signals/test_eventtime.py's `_thin_by_daily_profile` secondary
    control test — see that test's docstring), this simulator makes the
    baseline rate itself seasonal from the start, so it does not also
    discard already-realized self-excited "child" events the way
    post-hoc thinning does. It is the correct tool for testing that
    business-time rescaling recovers the true branching ratio from a
    seasonality-confounded Hawkes fit.

    Algorithm: same Ogata (1978) thinning / exponential-kernel excitation
    tracking as `simulate_hawkes_exp`, except the constant `mu` is replaced
    by `mu_bar*shape[bin_idx(t)]` and the thinning upper bound
    `lambda_bar = mu_bar*max(shape) + excitation + alpha*beta` uses the
    seasonal peak (`max(shape)`) instead of a constant baseline, since the
    baseline term is no longer constant between accepted events (only the
    excitation term's monotonic decay is exploited for the bound, same as
    the unseasonal simulator; the baseline swap point (bin boundary) is a
    negligible/zero-measure event under continuous-time thinning so no
    special-casing across bin boundaries is required for correctness).

    Sanity property: with `shape` identically 1 everywhere, this reduces
    statistically to `simulate_hawkes_exp(mu_bar, alpha, beta, t_end, seed)`
    (same distribution, not necessarily the same realized event times,
    since the acceptance draws differ once `lambda_bar` differs — verified
    in tests/estimators/test_hawkes.py via matched event-count and fitted-
    parameter statistics, not exact event-time equality).

    what makes the estimator "see" the amplification from clustering
    rather than just Poisson counting noise; too-small windows bias
    n_hat toward 0 (docs/research/02 §4: "short windows truncate long-memory
    kernels and bias n̂ down"). No kernel shape is assumed, which is the
    estimator's advantage (and, per the regime-switching trap test in
    tests/estimators/test_hawkes.py, also its weakness: it cannot
    distinguish real self-excitation from non-stationary baseline rate).

    Raises ValueError if fewer than 20 non-overlapping windows fit in
    [0, t_end], if window is so small it would require an unreasonable
    number of bins (>10^9 — see max_windows derivation below), or if the
    count variance is zero (degenerate/regular spacing), since none of
    these leave the estimator statistically meaningful.
