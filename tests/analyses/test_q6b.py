"""Tests for Q6b: kernel-K sensitivity panel.

Contract under test (see the q6b_kernel_sensitivity.py module docstring):
1. A planted TWO-timescale-kernel symbol (alpha=(0.25,0.35), beta=(5,0.2),
   true n=0.6) must show a large K=1->K=2 rise (Delta21 > 0.15) and n_hat_2
   within +-0.1 of 0.6 -- the headline "K=1 underestimates a genuinely
   long-memory kernel" finding.
2. A planted SINGLE-exponential-kernel symbol (n=0.4, well-specified at
   K=1) must show a small Delta21 (|Delta21| < 0.08) -- the negative
   control: no spurious rise when the true kernel really is K=1.
3. A missing symbol must land in `failures`, never abort the run.
4. Output files (.json/.md/.parquet/.png) must exist, and the parquet row
   count must equal the number of successful symbols.
5. The drift-suspect flagging logic (1/beta_slow at K=2 vs. the
   deseasonalization bin width) is unit-tested directly against
   `_is_drift_suspect`, independent of a full pipeline run.

Runtime: windows=2 and ks=(1,2) are used throughout (rather than the
production defaults windows=6, ks=(1,2,3)) to keep this file's wall clock
well under the ~90s synchronous budget -- fit_hawkes_multiexp's K=2 fit
dominates cost (~1.5-2s per ~30k-event window measured locally), so cutting
windows from 6 to 2 and dropping K=3 entirely is a ~6x-9x runtime reduction
relative to full production settings, at the cost of using only 2
(not 6) window-level samples for the per-symbol median -- acceptable here
since these tests assert Delta21 direction/magnitude with generous
tolerances, not exact production-panel point estimates. Each planted
fixture is sized to land in the ~35-45k event range (see the per-fixture
comments below), keeping each symbol's total fit cost (2 windows x 2 Ks)
in the single-digit seconds.

# matching the scale test_hawkes.py and test_q6.py's own single-exponential
# fixtures use), NOT the ~35-45k range the other planted fixtures use.
#
# WHY 60k AND NOT A LOOSER TOLERANCE (see `spurious_delta21_null`'s docstring
# in src/microstructure/estimators/hawkes.py for the full mechanism): the K=2
# fit has two more free parameters than K=1 and can always fit finite sample
# noise at least as well, so n_hat_2 carries an intrinsic upward finite-
# sample bias over n_hat_1 even when the true kernel really is K=1 -- this is
# NOT a local-optimum artifact of the multi-start search (measured directly:
# widening `betas_init` away from the default did not remove it on the
# window that showed the bias). The bias SHRINKS with sample size. At the
# fixture's old size (t_end=20_000 -> ~33k events -> ~16.6k/window at
# windows=2), Delta21 measured 0.107 at seed=7 -- above the old 0.08
# tolerance not because the estimator is broken, but because ~16.6k
# events/window is small enough for the K=2 fit's extra flexibility to
# meaningfully overfit sampling noise (one window's K=2 fit converged to
# betas=(0.021, 0.479) with a genuine ~11-nat log-likelihood improvement
# over K=1, despite the generative process having no second timescale at
# all). Raising to t_end=36_000 (-> ~59.5k events -> ~29.8k/window at
# seed=7) measured Delta21=0.0079 -- both because the estimator is less
# biased at this size (see the null below) and to give the fixture more
# margin over a moving null floor. This is a FIDELITY fix (more data makes
